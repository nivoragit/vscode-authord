# Authord VSCode Extension

Authord _(pronounced "Author-ed")_ brings documentation-as-code to Visual Studio Code, enabling a structured and efficient workflow for managing technical documentation alongside your code. It offers powerful features similar to JetBrains Writerside, tailored specifically for VSCode users.

## Features

- **Organized Documentation Management**: Maintain clear, structured documentation within your development workflow.
- **Seamless Navigation**: Easily browse and access documentation without disrupting your coding process.
- **Automated Synchronization**: Keep documentation up to date with minimal effort.
- **Effortless Editing**: Quickly open and modify documentation files with built-in support.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Utilize live previews and intuitive controls for a smooth documentation experience.

## Getting Started

1. Install the Authord extension in VS Code.
2. Click the Authord icon in the Activity Bar to create and manage documentation instances.

## Writerside Compatibility

Authord allows you to continue working on JetBrains Writerside projects within VS Code. While new Writerside projects cannot be created in Authord, existing projects can be easily maintained and updated within the extension.

## Known Limitations

- Currently, only a single instance per directory is supported. Multi-instance support is under development.
