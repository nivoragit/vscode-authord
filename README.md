## Topic Tree View

The extension provides a **Topics** Tree View in the Explorer pane.

- **Viewing Topics**: Expand the **Topics** section to view writerjet topics.
- **Interacting with Topics**: Right-click on a topic to see available actions.
- **Refreshing Topics**: Use the **Refresh Topics** command to reload the list.

## Configuration

You can configure the topics displayed by editing the extension settings:

```json
"writerjet.topics": ["Topic 1", "Topic 2"]
```

---

### **Next Steps**

- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Integrate with writerjet configuration files to display real topics and subtopics.
- **Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks when parsing configurations to handle exceptions.
- **User Interaction**: Implement more commands and context menu actions for tree items.
- **UI Enhancements**: Customize the Tree View with icons, tooltips, and descriptions.
