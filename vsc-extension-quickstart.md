# Welcome to authord VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for authord extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare authord extension and command.
  * The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesnâ€™t yet need to load the plugin.
* `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of authord command.
  * The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time authord extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
  * We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

## Setup

* install the recommended extensions (amodio.tsl-problem-matcher, ms-vscode.extension-test-runner, and dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)


## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with authord extension loaded.
* Run authord command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
* Set breakpoints in authord code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug authord extension.
* Find output from authord extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with authord extension to load authord changes.


## Explore the API

* You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

* Install the [Extension Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.extension-test-runner)
* Run the "watch" task via the **Tasks: Run Task** command. Make sure this is running, or tests might not be discovered.
* Open the Testing view from the activity bar and click the Run Test" button, or use the hotkey `Ctrl/Cmd + ; A`
* See the output of the test result in the Test Results view.
* Make changes to `src/test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test` folder.
  * The provided test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  * You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure authord tests any way you want.
